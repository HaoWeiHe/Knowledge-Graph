# Knowledge-Graph


A knowledge graph is a knowledge base that uses a graph-structured data model or topology to integrate data. Knowledge graphs are often used to store interlinked descriptions of entities – objects, events, situations or abstract concepts – with free-form semantics(from wiki). Here we demo a basic implementation of a knowledge graph using triples.
